Exercise:
Checkout the sample repo: git clone git@bitbucket.org:transact/ts-java-api-person.git.
Create a branch with your first initial followed by your last name, (e.g., 'jdoe').

1. The Person.email attribute should be unique. When creating a Person check for an existing email and throw an error if that email already exists for a Person.
2. Store an additional field 'zipcode' with the Person data.
3. Resolve the city of the Person.zipcode using this API, http://ziptasticapi.com. The city should NOT be persisted but should be returned with the Person response.
4. While retrieving all people, the list should be sorted by Person.lastName ascending.
5. Implement a delete endpoint to remove a Person.
